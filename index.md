**Things are getting weird out here on the internet.** Memes are being weaponized by extremists. Echo chambers have become easy targets for people who peddle outrage and misinformation.

What if we had more [memetic mediators](https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb) on the front lines of the information war?

Memetic mediation is understanding that good people can get infected by [bad pills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill). It's making meta-maps and field guides that inoculate us against ideological manipulation. It's bridging divides between siloed tribes. **We're Memetic Mediators—<span>Memedics</span> for short—and so are you.**
